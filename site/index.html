<section id="Tor"><div><b>Tor browser</b></div>
	<p>Tor is the browser which provide you to access privately any site which are banned in india . It changes your particular IP adrress from one location at certain time of interval so that no one can track you . If you are using tor browser you can understand what is deep web and dark web , but I recommend you that please don't acess dark weband deep web as they are totaly illigal which are strictly probhited in India(Tor is free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication. The name is derived from the acronym for the original software project name "The Onion Router".[6][7] Tor directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay network consisting of more than seven thousand relays[8] to conceal a user's location and usage from anyone conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis. Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace Internet activity to the user: this includes "visits to Web sites, online posts, instant messages, and other communication forms".[9] Tor's intended use is to protect the personal privacy of its users, as well as their freedom and ability to conduct confidential communication by keeping their Internet activities unmonitored.

Tor does not prevent an online service from determining when it is being accessed through Tor. Tor protects a user's privacy, but does not hide the fact that someone is using Tor. Some websites restrict allowances through Tor. For example, Wikipedia blocks attempts by Tor users to edit articles unless special permission is sought.[10]

Onion routing is implemented by encryption in the application layer of a communication protocol stack, nested like the layers of an onion. Tor encrypts the data, including the next node destination IP address, multiple times and sends it through a virtual circuit comprising successive, random-selection Tor relays. Each relay decrypts a layer of encryption to reveal the next relay in the circuit to pass the remaining encrypted data on to it. The final relay decrypts the innermost layer of encryption and sends the original data to its destination without revealing or knowing the source IP address. Because the routing of the communication was partly concealed at every hop in the Tor circuit, this method eliminates any single point at which the communicating peers can be determined through network surveillance that relies upon knowing its source and destination.[11]

An adversary may try to de-anonymize the user by some means. One way this may be achieved is by exploiting vulnerable software on the user's computer.[12] The NSA had a technique that targets a vulnerability – which they codenamed "EgotisticalGiraffe" – in an outdated Firefox browser version at one time bundled with the Tor package[13] and, in general, targets Tor users for close monitoring under its XKeyscore program.[14] Attacks against Tor are an active area of academic research[15][16] which is welcomed by the Tor Project itself.[17] The bulk of the funding for Tor's development has come from the federal government of the United States,[18] initially through the Office of Naval Research and DARPA). </p>

<section id="youtube premium"><div><b>YouTube premium</b></div><p>Youtube is one of the most used vedio searching application and it is very famous that everyone of us use as per the requirmets . Youtube also does side bussiness by selling its youtube premium among its user which provisde you addless content , million of song and some of the youtube original content(YouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) is a subscription service offered by the video platform YouTube. The service provides ad-free access to content across the service, as well access to premium YouTube Originals programming produced in collaboration with the site's creators, offline and background playback of videos on mobile devices, and access to the YouTube Music music streaming service.[5]

The service was originally launched in November 2014 as Music Key, offering only advertisement-free streaming of music videos from participating labels on YouTube and Google Play Music.[6][7][8] The service was then revised and relaunched as YouTube Red on October 31, 2015, expanding its scope to offer advertisement-free access to all YouTube videos, as opposed to just music.[9]

YouTube announced the rebranding of the service as YouTube Premium on May 17, 2018, alongside the return of a separate, YouTube Music subscription service.[10][11] Later in the year, it was reported that YouTube was planning to make some of the original content associated with the service available on an ad-supported basis). </p></section>

People in every part of the world watch movies as a type of entertainment, a way to have fun. For some people, fun movies can mean movies that make them laugh, while for others it can mean movies that make them cry, or feel afraid.

Most movies are made so that they can be shown on big screens at movie theatres and at home. After movies are shown on movie screens for a period of weeks or months, they may be marketed through several other media. They are shown on pay television or cable television, and sold or rented on DVD disks or videocassette tapes, so that people can watch the movies at home. You can also download or stream movies.
